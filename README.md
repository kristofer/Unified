# Unified
Claude and I designed a language!
I'd love to design a programming language! This is a fascinating thought experiment.

If I were to create a new programming language that unifies concepts across imperative languages while maintaining their strengths, here's what I'd envision:

# Unified

I'd call it "Unified" - a language that takes the most compelling features from various languages while addressing common pain points.

## Core Design Principles

1. **Pragmatic simplicity** - Like Go and Lua, the language would have a small, consistent core with clear semantics
2. **Memory safety without GC overhead** - Borrowing Rust's ownership model but with more ergonomic syntax
3. **Type flexibility** - Gradual typing like TypeScript that allows both dynamic exploration and static verification
4. **Concurrency by design** - Built-in concurrency primitives from Go and Erlang/Elixir
5. **Expression-oriented** - Everything is an expression (like Rust and functional languages)

## Key Features

```unified
// Pattern matching and algebraic data types (from Rust/ML family)
type Result<T, E> = Success(T) | Error(E)

// First-class functions with closures (like JavaScript/Rust)
fn map<T, U>(list: List<T>, transform: fn(T) -> U) -> List<U> {
    // Implementation
}

// Ownership system with ergonomic borrowing (inspired by Rust)
fn process(data: &mut String) {
    // Mutable borrow
}

// Erlang/Elixir-style concurrency with lightweight processes
actor Counter {
    var count = 0
    
    fn increment() {
        count += 1
        return count
    }
}

// Go-style error handling but with Result types
fn read_file(path: String) -> Result<String, IOError> {
    // Implementation
}

// String interpolation (from Swift/JavaScript)
let message = "Hello, ${name}!"
```


Let's see the possibility of creating a language that handles the memory safety/performance tradeoff better than existing options - something with Rust's safety guarantees but Go's approachability and development speed.
